## Decision Made
| # | Area  | Decision | Alternative | Rationale
| ----------- | ----------- | --- | --- |--- |
| 1 | IDE | Use VS Code |IntelliJ, Eclipse | Language independent editor so that it can be used in non java course
| 2 | Dependency Management  | Maven | Gradle | Since it caused too much learn curve to come up to speed on Gradle
| 3 | Code  | Lombok | Code template code | We have done too many template code and so don't need to learn that
| 4 | Configuration Management  | Yaml | Properties | Easier to view groups of configuration and it is different than what we learned in other classes with property files and so using this opporutnity to learn something different
